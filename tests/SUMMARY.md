# Testing Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document provides a summary of the testing implementation for the Uncertain Value Calculator project. The goal was to create comprehensive tests for all scenarios and systems in the project.

## What Has Been Implemented

### 1. Testing Framework Setup

- Installed and configured Vitest as the test runner
- Set up Vue Test Utils for component testing
- Configured JSDOM for DOM testing
- Created a structured test directory organization

### 2. Unit Tests

#### Calculator Component

Comprehensive unit tests have been written for the Calculator component's core logic:

- **tokenizeExpression**: Tests for parsing input expressions into tokens
- **evaluateTokens**: Tests for identifying distributions in tokenized expressions
- **evaluateMathExpression**: Tests for evaluating mathematical expressions with proper order of operations
- **performOperation**: Tests for operations between different types of operands:
  - Number-to-number operations
  - Normal distribution operations
  - Uniform distribution operations
  - Mixed distribution operations
  - Edge cases like division by zero
- **formatResult**: Tests for formatting different types of results for display

#### ThemeToggle Component

Unit tests for the ThemeToggle component cover:

- Rendering with the correct default theme
- Toggling between light and dark themes
- Emitting theme change events
- Updating the DOM with theme classes

### 3. Integration Tests

Integration tests have been implemented to test component interactions:

- **App Integration**: Tests for the interaction between App, Calculator, and ThemeToggle components
- **Calculator Integration**: Tests for the end-to-end calculation flow, including:
  - Button clicks
  - Keyboard input
  - Display updates
  - Result calculation and display
  - Distribution handling

### 4. Documentation

Comprehensive documentation has been created:

- **README.md**: General testing documentation
- **troubleshooting.md**: Guide for troubleshooting test execution issues

## Potential Areas for Improvement

While the current test suite is comprehensive, there are some areas that could be enhanced in the future:

1. **Visual Testing**: The current tests focus on logic and functionality. Visual regression testing could be added to ensure the UI appears correctly.

2. **Canvas Testing**: The tests for the distribution visualization are limited due to the complexity of testing canvas operations. More sophisticated mocking of canvas methods could improve this.

3. **End-to-End Testing**: True end-to-end tests using tools like Cypress or Playwright could be added to test the application in a real browser environment.

4. **Performance Testing**: Tests for performance aspects, especially for complex calculations with large distributions, could be beneficial.

5. **Accessibility Testing**: Tests to ensure the application is accessible to all users could be added.

## Conclusion

The implemented test suite provides comprehensive coverage of the application's core functionality, ensuring that:

- The calculator correctly handles all types of mathematical operations
- Distributions (normal and uniform) are correctly processed and displayed
- The theme toggle functionality works as expected
- User interactions (button clicks, keyboard input) are properly handled

These tests will help maintain the quality of the application as new features are added or existing ones are modified.
