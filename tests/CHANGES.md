# Changes Made to Enable Running Tests in IntelliJ IDEA

## Issue Description

The issue was to enable running tests directly through IntelliJ IDEA instead of using npm commands, as there were test failures when running through npm.

## Changes Made

1. **Created IntelliJ Run Configurations**:
   - Created `.idea/runConfigurations` directory
   - Added three run configurations:
     - `Vitest.xml`: Runs all tests in watch mode
     - `Vitest_Coverage.xml`: Runs all tests with coverage reporting
     - `Vitest_Current_File.xml`: Runs the currently open test file

2. **Added Documentation**:
   - Created `tests/intellij-test-instructions.md` with detailed instructions on:
     - How to run tests through IntelliJ
     - How to debug tests
     - How to view test results and coverage
     - Troubleshooting tips

## Benefits

1. **Improved Developer Experience**:
   - Tests can now be run directly from the IDE
   - Easier debugging with breakpoints and IDE integration
   - Better visualization of test results and coverage

2. **More Reliable Test Execution**:
   - Running tests through IntelliJ may avoid the timeout issues encountered with npm
   - Better integration with the IDE's debugging tools

3. **Flexibility**:
   - Multiple ways to run tests (all tests, specific files, individual tests)
   - Options for running with or without coverage

## Next Steps

After implementing these changes, developers should:

1. Restart IntelliJ IDEA to load the new run configurations
2. Follow the instructions in `tests/intellij-test-instructions.md` to run tests
3. Report any issues or improvements needed for the test configurations
